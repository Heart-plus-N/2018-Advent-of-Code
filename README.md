# 2018 Advent of Code Challenge

Solutions by the `<3+N` coders to the 2018 Advent of Code Challenge.


## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles by Eric Wastl for a variety of skill sets and skill levels in any programming language you like.  Problems are released nightly between December 1 and 25, 2018 (midnight EST/UTC-5).

## Participation

Assumes you have:

* Elected to participate in the `<3+N` challenge on Habitica
* Created a GitHub account

Once you've done that,

1. Fork this repo into your own account
2. Make a folder with your Habitica display name and the language you will implement in.  For example, `NeuralKnight-JavaScript`
3. Do whatever setup you want in that folder.  Treat it like your project root.  For example, a JavaScript project might run `npm init` and exclude node_modules in a .gitignore file.  A README.md would be helpful for other people to run your code
4. Create a folder for each day of the challenge: `day-1/`
5. Submit a pull request with your solutions to the day's problems plus any changes to your project root and we'll add it to the community repo


## Disclaimer

The Advent of Code challenge is by Eric Wastl who is not affiliated with `<3+N`.  Within the Habitica platform, `<3+N` has also created a "challenge" (with an in-game reward) for members to participate in the Advent of Code challenge.  Understanding which challenge the word "challenge" refers to is challenging.  We regret the confusion.
