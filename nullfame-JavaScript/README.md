# JavaScript Solutions to 2018 Advent of Code Challenge

## JavaScript Environment

* NPM 6.4.1
* Node 8.11.2

Older and newer versions may work

## Setup

None (but running `npm install` won't hurt anybody), other than the assumption that your environment is running Node and NPM.

## Usage

* `npm run day-N` (e.g., day-1, day-2, day-25)
