# Running the code

Since we're given test cases I used `ExUnit` to test them against the code.

To ease the running and playing with the code I recommend using a docker image. [Install docker from here](https://docs.docker.com/). Then run the below code **making sure to change the number of the day accordingly** and you are inside the day's folder. It will automatically download the correct image and run the code. Information about the test cases passing will be printed on the screen. [Click here to see how to run other bit of elixir in docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/elixir/).

`docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp elixir:1.7.4-alpine elixir day-1_test.exs`
